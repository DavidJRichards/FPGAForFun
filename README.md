### Max7219YouTube Project

This project is from the first two videos and covers the initial wiring of the Max7219 8-digit 7-segment display module. It contains the Lucid HDL code for the implementation as well as the transpiled Verilog source.

### Max7219 Counter
![FPGA Counter](https://github.com/cerkit/FPGAForFun/blob/master/Max7219Counter/diagrams/FunWithFPGACounter.png?raw=true)

This project wires a Max7219 8-digit 7-segment display module to the Mojo FPGA. The HDL being used is Lucid (the language for the Mojo from Embedded Micro). However, the transpiled Verilog sources are available in the [/work/verilog](https://github.com/cerkit/FPGAForFun/tree/master/Max7219Counter/work/verilog) subfolder.
